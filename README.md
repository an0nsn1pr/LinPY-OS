Hello LinPY user.

This is notes about versions of LinPY meaning new additions, bugfixes, removing stuff etc.
I am going to be reporting from version Beta 1.8 because i mad not that smart lol.
The first official release with be when i finish Beta 3.x. I want to make the basic controls and commands on version
Beta 1, security update on Beta 2 and tools and maybe browsers in Beta 3. I hope i can make this "OS" to be secure,
to be able to hide your files, documents, passwords, maybe even databases. I hope you enjoy it and have a nice day :D

Version Beta 1.8
BIG UPDATE

In the previous versions you couldnt use LinPY without the files already set up by the user, now it does it for you :D
I want to develop changecommand feature, kind of an allias.


Version Beta 1.9
MASSIVE UPDATE( ;) )
i love cats :3

New commands: ping, netdiscover, changecmd, pdcmd, restorecmd, sys

You can now ping IPs or domains with the "ping" command, if you add a number after the IP, you ping that IP x4 of that number
You can now see who is in your subnet using "netdiscover" command. Use: netdiscover [subnet, example: 192.168.0.] , yes the . has to be in the end
You can now change commands and their use with "changecmd" command. Use: changecmd [previous command name] [new command name]
Warning: If you want to change a command back, you need to use "restorecmd", this will reset all the commands tho
If you want to see the default commands, use "pdcmd" - short for "print default commands"

Fixed: lsall, credits

In the prvious updates, "lsall" showed only the ROOT folders, now it shows all the files in the filesystem.
Now the "credits" command works and the credits goes to myself :D (for now)

I hope that this is the last update before Beta 2. In Beta 2 i want to add an exe installer, make the system so secure that it would take feds days to find.
I also want to add a kill switch so that when the feds are at your house you can delete the easily. 

This is it for BETA 1
cya in the next one:D
