Hello LinPY user.

This is notes about versions of LinPY meaning new additions, bugfixes, removing stuff etc.
I am going to be reporting from version Beta 1.8 because i mad not that smart lol.
The first official release with be when i finish Beta 3.x. I want to make the basic controls and commands on version
Beta 1, security update on Beta 2 and tools and maybe browsers in Beta 3. I hope i can make this "OS" to be secure,
to be able to hide your files, documents, passwords, maybe even databases. I hope you enjoy it and have a nice day :D

Version Beta 1.8
BIG UPDATE

In the previous versions you couldnt use LinPY without the files already set up by the user, now it does it for you :D
I want to develop changecommand feature, kind of an allias.
